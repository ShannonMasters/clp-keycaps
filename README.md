# CLP Contoured Low Profile MX Keycaps

The repository contains these folders:

- **fusion360** – source files for [Autodesk Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview).
- **stl** – 3D models for any CAD or Slicer software.
- **assets** – folder that contains images and actual photos of keycaps.

There are currently twelve variants of keycaps:

- **Normal**. A normal dished keycap.
- **Normal Homing**. Same as Normal, but has three little bumps, commonly used for home row index fingers.
- **Saddle**. A saddle-shaped keycap, similar to the Chicago Steno keycaps.
- **Saddle Homing**. Same as Saddle, but has three little bumps, commonly used for home row index fingers.
- **Thumb**. Same as Normal, but the front side is lowered so it's more comfortable to press with a thumb.
- **Thumb 1.5u**. Larger Thumb 1.5u keycap, has a 7° tilt and a lowered front side.
- **Tilted 7°**. Same as Normal, but top profile has a 7° tilt and one side is lowered.
- **Tilted 7° Slanted 10°**. Same as Tilted 7°, but the top profile is slanted 10° to the left/right (two variants).
- **Tilted 14°**. Same as Normal, but top profile has a 14° tilt and one side is lowered.
- **Tilted 14° Slanted 10°**. Same as Tilted 14°, but the top profile is slanted 10° to the left/right (two variants).

## How to print?

There are combined files that you can use in any 3D-printing service like [JLCPCB](https://3d.jlcpcb.com/3d-printing/stereolithography) or [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/3d-printing/). Combining models into one file is a good way to save money on printing as printing services often charge a minimum price per model.

## Acknowledgements

As always this project wouldn't be possible without standing on the shoulders of giants. I took a lot of inspiration from braindefender's [KLP Lame keycaps](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps/). Although I feel like my keycaps are different enough to be a distinct and separate project, I still want to mention and thank braindefender for his excellent work.
Another source of inspiration was [Pseudoku's Distorted Ellipsoidal Saddle (DES) and Chicago Stenographer](https://github.com/toniz4/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles).
